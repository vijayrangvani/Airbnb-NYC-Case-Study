# Airbnb-NYC-Case-Study

Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short-term lodging and tourism-related activities.

New York City is the most diverse and populated city in the United States. The city is made up of 5 boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island, all of which were “grouped” together into a single city. It is widely recognized as the global centre for the financial services industry. It’s also the heartbeat of the American media, entertainment (along with California), telecommunications, law and advertising industries.

Problem statement: In January 2020, Airbnb saw 50.2 million website visits. But with the onset of the pandemic, Airbnb was one of the many businesses in the travel industry to be hit hard.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbnb bookings dropped as much as 96% in some cities. Due to this, Airbnb has seen a major decline in revenue.
